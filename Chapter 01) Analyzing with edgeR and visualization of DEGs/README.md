# Chapter 01) Analyzing with edgeR and visualization of DEGs

In this chapter, I will show how to analyze RNA-Seq raw data which was simply preprocessed using dplyr packages.

First, the method how to analyze raw count data with edgeR will be shown. 

Second, based on the result, raw dataset and DEG dataset will be seperated and saved.

Lastly, visualization the results above using volcano plots and Venn diagrams will be shown.

â€» The ENSEMBL ID and raw counts were randomly selected and modified.
