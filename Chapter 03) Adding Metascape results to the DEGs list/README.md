# Chapter 03) Adding Metascape results to the DEGs list

In this chapter, I will show how to preprocess the downloaded data from Metascape and merge with the DEGs list.

The Metascape data includes useful enrichment results that must be added on RNA-Seq studies, however,

Statistical information such as logFC or FDR are not attached on the data.

Thus, we need to merge them together so that we can browse Ensembl ID, gene names, logFC, FDR, and enrichment information at once.

This process would be complicated process but when the process is completed, you will get informative data.
